    ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate - Servers' blade with the 'Overview' button in the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' panel highlighted.](Images/overviewnew.png "Overview link")
    
9. Confirm that the 1 machines are replicating.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' overview blade showing the replication state as 'Healthy' for 3 servers.](Images/Replication4.png "Replication summary")

10. Select **Replicating Machines** under **Manage** on the left.  Select **Refresh** occasionally and wait until all three machines have a **Protected** status, which shows the initial replication is complete. This will take 5-10 minutes.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration - Replicating machines' blade showing the replication status as 'Protected' for all 3 servers.](Images/Replication5.png "Replication status")


#### Task summary 

In this task you enabled replication from the Hyper-V host to Azure Migrate, and configured the replicated VM size in Azure.

### Task 3: Configure Networking

In this task you will modify the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine.

1. Still using the **Migration and modernization - Replicating machines** blade, select the **UbuntuVM** virtual machine. This opens a detailed migration and replication blade for this machine. Take a moment to study this information.

   ![Screenshot from the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration - Replicating machines' blade with the smarthotelweb1 machine highlighted.](Images/Replication6.png "Replicating machines")

2. Select **Compute and Network** under **General** on the left, then select **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of the smarthotelweb1 blade with the 'Compute and Network' and 'Edit' links highlighted.](Images/Replication7.png "Edit Compute and Network settings")

3. Confirm that the VM is configured to use the **F2s_v2** VM size.

4. Under **Network Interfaces**, select **InternalNATSwitch** to open the network interface settings.

   ![Screenshot showing the link to edit the network interface settings for a replicated VM.](Images/nic.png "Network Interface settings link")

5. Change the **Private IP address** to **192.168.0.8**.

   ![Screenshot showing a private IP address being configured for a replicated VM in ASR.](Images/private-ip.png "Network interface - static private IP address")

6. Select **OK** to close the network interface settings blade, then **Save** the **UbuntuVM** settings to configure the private IP address for the VMs.


#### Task summary 

In this task you modified the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine

> **Note**: Azure Migrate makes a "best guess" at the VM settings, but you have full control over the settings of migrated items. In this case, setting a static private IP address ensures the virtual machines in Azure retain the same IPs they had on-premises, which avoids having to reconfigure the VMs during migration (for example, by editing web.config files).


### Task 4: Server migration

In this task you will perform a migration of the UbuntuWAF, smarthotelweb1, and smarthotelweb2 machines to Azure.

> **Note**: In a real-world scenario, you would perform a test migration before the final migration. To save time, you will skip the test migration in this lab. The test migration process is very similar to the final migration.

1. Return to the **Migration and modernization** overview blade. Under **Step 3: Migrate**, select **Migrate**.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' overview blade, with the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/Migration1.png "Replication summary")

2. On the **Migrate** blade, select **yes** for **Shutdown machines before migration to minimum data loss** and select the **UbuntuVM** virtual machine then select **Migrate** to start the migration process.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Migrate' blade, with 3 machines selected and the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/Migration2.png "Migrate - VM selection")

   > **Note**: You can optionally choose whether the on-premises virtual machines should be automatically shut down before migration to minimize data loss. Either setting will work for this lab.

3. The migration process will start.

   ![Screenshot showing 3 VM migration notifications.](Images/Migration3.png "Migration started notifications")

4. To monitor progress, select **Jobs** under **Manage** on the left and review the status of the three **Planned failover** jobs.

   ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with 3 in-progress 'Planned failover' jobs.](Images/Migration4.png "Migration jobs")

5. **Wait** until all three **Planned failover** jobs show a **Status** of **Successful**. You should not need to refresh your browser. This could take up to 15 minutes.

   ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with all 'Planned failover' jobs successful.](Images/Migration5.png "Migration status")

6. Navigate to the **SmartHotelRG** resource group and check that the VM, network interface, and disk resources have been created for each of the virtual machine being migrated.

   ![Screenshot showing resources created by the test failover (VMs, disks, and network interfaces).](Images/Migration6.png "Migrated resources")

#### Task summary 

In this task you used Azure Migrate to create Azure VMs using the settings you have configured, and the data replicated from the Hyper-V machines. This migrated your on-premises VMs to Azure.


### Task 5: Configure the database connection

The application tier machine **smarthotelweb2** is configured to connect to the application database running on the **smarthotelsql** machine.

On the migrated VM **smarthotelweb2**, this configuration needs to be updated to use the Azure SQL Database instead.

> **Note**: You do not need to update any configuration files on **smarthotelweb1** or the **UbuntuWAF** VMs, since the migration has preserved the private IP addresses of all virtual machines they connect with.

1. From the Azure portal menu which is present at the top left, click on **All services**. Select **compute** from the left hand menu and select **Virtual machines**.

2. Click on **smarthotelweb2** VM, from the overview blade, and select **Connect**. Select **Bastion** from the available options and click on **Use Bastion**.

   **Note:** You may have to wait a few minutes and refresh to have the option to enter the credentials. 

3. Connect to the machine with the username **Administrator** and the password <inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password"></inject>. When prompted, **Allow** clipboard access.

   ![Screenshot showing the Azure Bastion connection blade.](Images/web2-connect.png "Connect using Bastion")

4. In the **smarthotelweb2** remote desktop session, open File Explorer and navigate to the **C:\\inetpub\\SmartHotel.Registration.Wcf** folder. Double-select the **Web.config** file and open with Notepad.

5. Update the **DefaultConnection** setting to connect to your Azure SQL Database.

   You can find the connection string for the Azure SQL Database in the Azure portal. Navigate to the **SmartHotelRG** resource group, and then to the database **smarthoteldb** and  from the overview, select **Show database connection strings**.

   ![Screenshot showing the 'Show database connection strings' link for an Azure SQL Database.](Images/show-connection-strings.png "Show database connection strings")

    Copy the **ADO.NET** connection string, and paste into the web.config file on **smarthotelweb2**, replacing the existing connection string.  **Be careful not to overwrite the 'providerName' parameter which is specified after the connection string.**

    > **Note:** You may need to open the clipboard panel on the left-hand edge of the Bastion window, paste the connection string there, and then paste into the VM.

    Set the password in the connection string to **<inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password" />**.

    ![Screenshot showing the user ID and Password in the web.config database connection string.](Images/web2-connection-string.png "web.config")

6. **Save** the `web.config` file and exit your Bastion remote desktop session.

#### Task summary 

In this task, you updated the **smarthotelweb2** configuration to connect to the Azure SQL Database.

### Task 6: Configure the public IP address and test the SmartHotel application

In this task, you will associate an Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall (WAF) to replace the Ubuntu VM with the Azure managed service.

1. Navigate to the **SmartHotel-WAF** Application Gateway in the **SmartHotelRG** resource group

1. Select **Backend pools** under the Settings section, and select the **WebBackend** pool

    ![Screenshot showing the backend pool selection for the Application Gateway](Images/waf-backend-pool.png "Select WebBackend")

    ![](Images/deny-firewalls-sqlserver1.png)
   
1. Navigate back to the **SmartHotel-WAF** Application Gateway then **Frontend IP configurations** way in the Settings section, and note the IP address associated with the public IP address **appGwPublicFrontendIp**.

    ![Screenshot showing public IP address of the Application Gateway that is now associated with the backend VM.](Images/waf-public-ip-address.png "Public IP address of AppGW")

1. Open a new browser tab and paste the IP address into the address bar. Verify that the SmartHotel360 application is now available in Azure.

    ![Screenshot showing the SmartHotel application.](Images/lob-issue-02.png "Migrated SmartHotel application")
 
    > **Note**: 
      1. The Check-in and Check-out might differ for you when compared to the above screenshot.
      2. At this point the base Application Gateway service is providing access to the backend application. This validates that the application is working and can be further protected by the WAF in following steps.

1. Select **Web application firewall** under the Settings section and change the Tier to **WAF V2**.  Also, change the Firewall status to **Enabled**, the Firewall mode to **Prevention**, and set the Max request body size (KB) to **32**.  Select **Save** to commit the changes.
