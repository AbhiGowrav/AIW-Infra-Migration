## HOL3: Exercise 2: Configure ASR for on-premises infrastructure

In this exercise, you will deploy disaster recovery of on-premises Hyper-V VM to Azure. The Azure Site Recovery service contributes to your disaster-recovery strategy by managing and orchestrating replication, failover, and failback of on-premises machines. As part of the registration process, you will deploy the Azure Site Recovery Provider on your Hyper-V host.
