### HOL3: Exercise 4: Failover the infrastructure to Azure Cloud.

After setting up replication to Azure for on-premises machines, when your on-premises site goes down, you fail those machines over to Azure. After failover, Azure VMs are created from replicated data.

1. If you are not logged in already, click on Azure portal shortcut that is available on the desktop and log in with below Azure credentials.
    * Azure Username/Email: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> 
    * Azure Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

1. In the **search resources, services and docs bar**, type **Recovery service vaults** and select it from suggestions, as shown below:

1. On the **Recovery Service Vault page**, click **Replicated Items (1)** under **Protected Items** and select **smartholweb1 (2)** that you replicated in the previous exercise.

1. On the **replicated smarthotelweb1** page, click on **Commit** to commit the failover (The Commit action deletes all the recovery points available with the service).

1. After the Failover is **committed successfully**, go to the **search resources, services and docs bar**, type **Virtual Machines** and select it from suggestions.   

1. Under **Virtual Machines** page, select the **smarthotelweb1** which is automatically created from replicated data after a Failover.
