# HOL 2: Migrate and modernize Linux & OSS DB workloads to Azure


In this Module, you will use Azure Migrate: Server Assessment to assess the on-premises environment. This will include selecting Azure Migrate tools, deploying the Azure Migrate appliance into the on-premises environment, creating a migration assessment, and using the Azure Migrate dependency visualization.

### Exercise 1: Discovery, Assess, and Plan: Evaluate your current environment

In this exercise, you will deploy the Azure Migrate appliance in the on-premises Hyper-V environment. This appliance communicates with the Hyper-V server to gather configuration and performance data about your on-premises VMs, and returns that data to your Azure Migrate project.

### Exercise 2: Set up your environment on Azure to migrate servers

### Task 1: Create a migration assessment

In this task, you will use Azure Migrate to create a migration assessment for the SmartHotel application, using the data gathered during the discovery phase.

1. Select **Assess** under **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment** and click on **Azure VM** to start a new migration assessment.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate portal blade, with the '+Assess' button highlighted.](Images/Assessment1.png "Start assessment")

2. On the Assess servers blade, ensure the Assessment type to be **Azure VM** and Discovery Source to be **Servers discovered from Migrate Appliance**. Under **Assessment settings**, select **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Assess servers' blade, showing the assessment name.](Images/assessment1.png "Assess servers - assessment name")

3. The **Assessment settings** blade allows you to tailor many of the settings used when making a migration assessment report. Take a few moments to explore the wide range of assessment properties. Hover over the information icons to see more details on each setting. Choose any settings you like, then select **Save**. (You have to make a change for the Save button to be enabled; if you don't want to make any changes, just close the blade.)

   ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Assessment properties' blade, showing a wide range of migration assessment settings.](Images/assessment2.png "Assessment properties")

4. Select **Next** to move to the **Select servers to assess** tab and enter the following information:
     
     1. Assessment name: Enter **SmartHotelAssessment** 
     1. Select or create a group: Choose **Create New** and enter the 
     1. Group name: Enter **Linux VMs**.
     1. Add machines to the Group:  Select **UbuntuVM** from dropdown.
     1. Select the **UbuntuVM** VMs and
     1.  Click on **Next**.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Assess servers' page. A new server group containing servers smarthotelweb1, smarthotelweb2, and UbuntuWAF.](Images/Assessment2.png "Assessment VM group")

    **Note:** There is no need to include the **smarthotelSQL1** or **AzureMigrateAppliance** VMs in the assessment, since they will not be migrated to Azure. (The SQL Server will be migrated to the SQL Database service and the Azure Migrate Appliance is only used for migration assessment.)

5. Click on **Create assessment** to create the assessment. 

   ![](Images/Assessment4.png)

6. On the **Servers, databases and web apps** blade, select **Refresh** periodically until the number of assessments shown is **1** (This may take few minutes). Once the assessments count is updated, click on **1** that is next to **Total** under **Assessments**.  

    ![Screenshot from Azure Migrate showing the number of assessments as '1'.](Images/E1T4S6.png "Azure Migrate - Assessments (count)")
    
7. Select **Assessments** under **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment** to see a list of assessments. Then select the actual assessment.

   ![Screenshot showing a list of Azure Migrate assessments. There is only one assessment in the list. It has been highlighted.](Images/Assessment3.png "Azure Migrate - Assessments (list)")

### Task 2: Configure dependency visualization

When migrating a workload to Azure, it is important to understand all workload dependencies. A broken dependency could mean that the application doesn't run properly in Azure, perhaps in hard-to-detect ways. Some dependencies, such as those between application tiers, are obvious. Other dependencies, such as DNS lookups, Kerberos ticket validation or certificate revocation checks, are not.

In this task, you will configure the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature. This requires you to first create a Log Analytics workspace, and then to deploy agents on the to-be-migrated VMs.

1. Return to the **Azure Migrate** blade in the Azure Portal, select **Servers, databases and web apps (1)**. Under **Discovery and assessment** select **Groups (2)**,

    ![](Images/E1T5S1.png)   

2. Select the **Linux VMs** group to see the group details. 

   ![](Images/Groups1.png)   

3. Note that each VM has their **Dependencies** status as **Requires agent installation**. Select **Requires agent installation** for the **UbuntuVM** VM.

   ![Screenshot showing the SmartHotel VMs group. Each VM has dependency status 'Requires agent installation'.](Images/Groups2.png "SmartHotel VMs server group")

4. On the **Dependencies** blade, select **Configure Log Analytics workspace**.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Dependencies' blade, with the 'Configure OMS Workspace' button highlighted.](Images/configureLAW.png "Configure OMS Workspace link")

5. On the **Configure Log Analytics workspace** blade, provide the below information and select **Configure**.

   - Log Analytics workspace: Click on **Create new** and enter **AzureMigrateWS<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**
   - Log Analytics workspace location: Select **East US** from the dropdown.

  ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Configure OMS workspace' blade.](Images/createLAW.png "OMS Workspace settings")

6. Wait for the workspace to be deployed. Once it is deployed, navigate to **AzureMigrateWS<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** by clicking on it.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Configure OMS workspace' blade.](Images/omsworkspace.png "OMS Workspace settings")

7. Select **Agents management** under **Settings** from the left hand side menu. Make a note of the **Workspace ID** and **Primary Key** (for example by using Notepad).

   ![Screenshot of part of the Azure Migrate 'Dependencies' blade, showing the OMS workspace ID and key.](Images/workspace-id-key.png "OMS Workspace ID and primary key")

8. You will now deploy the Linux versions of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent and Dependency Agent on the **UbuntuVM** VM. To do so, you will first connect to the UbuntuWAF remotely using an SSH session.

9. Open a command prompt using the desktop shortcut.  

    > **Note**: The SmartHotelHost runs Windows Server 2019 with the Windows Subsystem for Linux enabled. This allows the command prompt to be used as an SSH client. More info of supported Linux on Azure can be found here: https://Azure.com/Linux. 

10. Enter the following command to connect to the **UbuntuWAF** VM running in Hyper-V on the SmartHotelHost:

    ```bash
    ssh demouser@192.168.0.7
    ```

11. Enter 'yes' when prompted whether to connect. Use the password **<inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password" />**.

    ![Screenshot showing the command prompt with an SSH session to UbuntuWAF.](Images/ssh.png "SSH session with UbuntuWAF")

12. Enter the following command, followed by the password **<inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password" />** when prompted:
  
    ```
    sudo -s
    ```

    > This gives the terminal session elevated privileges.

13. Enter the following command, substituting \<Workspace ID\> and \<Workspace Key\> with the values copied previously. Answer **Yes** when prompted to restart services during package upgrades without asking.  

    ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.sh && sh onboard_agent.sh -w <Workspace ID> -s <Workspace Key>
    ```

14. Enter the following command, substituting \<Workspace ID\> with the value copied earlier:

    ```s
    /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart <Workspace ID>
    ```

15. Enter the following command. This downloads a script that will install the Dependency Agent.

    ```s
    wget --content-disposition https://aka.ms/dependencyagentlinux -O InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin
    ```

16. Install the dependency agent by running the script download in the previous step.

    ```s
    sh InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin -s
    ```

    ![Screenshot showing that the Dependency Agent install on Linux was successful.](Images/da-linux-done.png "Dependency Agent installation was successful")
    

17. Return to the Azure Portal and refresh the Azure Migrate **SmartHotel VMs** VM group blade. The 3 VMs on which the dependency agent was installed should now show their status as **Installed**. (If not, refresh the page **using the browser refresh button**, not the refresh button in the blade.  It may take up to **5 minutes** after installation for the status to be updated.)

   ![Screenshot showing the dependency agent installed on each VM in the Azure Migrate VM group.](Images/Linux-depencyagent.png "Dependency agent installed")
   
   >**Note**: If you notice that the dependency agent status is showing as **Requires Agent Installation** instead of Installed even after installing dependency agents in all the three VMs, please follow the steps from [here](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Know-Before-You-Go/blob/main/AIW-KBYG/AIW-Infrastructure-Migration.md#4-exercise1---task6---step1) to confirm dependency agent installation in VMs using Log Analytics workspace.
 
18. Select **View dependencies**.

   ![Screenshot showing the view dependencies button in the Azure Migrate VM group blade.](Images/view-dependencies.png "View dependencies")
   
19. Take a few minutes to explore the dependencies view. Expand each server to show the processes running on that server. Select a process to see process information. See which connections each server makes.

    ![Screenshot showing the dependencies view in Azure Migrate.](Images/dependencies1.png "Dependency map")
 
#### Task summary 

In this task you configured the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature, by creating a Log Analytics workspace and deploying the Azure Monitoring Agent and Dependency Agent on Linux on-premises machine.

## Exercise 3: Migrating your apps and your data, leveraging Microsoft services and tools like Azure Migrate, the Azure Hybrid Benefit, and other tools and programs. 

### Task 1: Create a Storage Account

In this task you will create a new Azure Storage Account that will be used by Migration and for storage of your virtual machine data during migration.

> **Note:** This lab focuses on the technical tools required for workload migration. In a real-world scenario, more consideration should go into the long-term plan prior to migrating assets. The landing zone required to host VMs should also include considerations for network traffic, access control, resource organization, and governance. For example, the CAF Migration Blueprint and CAF Foundation Blueprint can be used to deploy a pre-defined landing zone, and demonstrate the potential of an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach to infrastructure resource management. For more information, see [Azure Landing Zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/) and [Cloud Adoption Framework Azure Migration landing zone Blueprint sample](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/samples/caf-migrate-landing-zone/).

1. In the Azure portal's left navigation, select **+ Create a resource**, then search for and select **Storage account**, followed by **Create**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the create storage account navigation.](Images/create-storage-1.png "Storage account - Create")

#### Task summary 

In this task you enabled replication from the Hyper-V host to Azure Migrate, and configured the replicated VM size in Azure.

### Task 4: Configure Networking

In this task you will modify the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine.

1. Still using the **Migration and modernization - Replicating machines** blade, select the **UbuntuVM** virtual machine. This opens a detailed migration and replication blade for this machine. Take a moment to study this information.

   ![Screenshot from the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration - Replicating machines' blade with the smarthotelweb1 machine highlighted.](Images/Replication6.png "Replicating machines")

2. Select **Compute and Network** under **General** on the left, then select **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of the smarthotelweb1 blade with the 'Compute and Network' and 'Edit' links highlighted.](Images/Replication7.png "Edit Compute and Network settings")

   ![Screenshot showing the link to edit the network interface settings for a replicated VM.](Images/nic.png "Network Interface settings link")

5. Change the **Private IP address** to **192.168.0.8**.

   ![Screenshot showing a private IP address being configured for a replicated VM in ASR.](Images/private-ip.png "Network interface - static private IP address")

6. Select **OK** to close the network interface settings blade, then **Save** the **UbuntuVM** settings to configure the private IP address for the VMs.


#### Task summary 

In this task you modified the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine

> **Note**: Azure Migrate makes a "best guess" at the VM settings, but you have full control over the settings of migrated items. In this case, setting a static private IP address ensures the virtual machines in Azure retain the same IPs they had on-premises, which avoids having to reconfigure the VMs during migration (for example, by editing web.config files).


### Task 5: Server migration

In this task you will perform a migration of the UbuntuWAF, smarthotelweb1, and smarthotelweb2 machines to Azure.

> **Note**: In a real-world scenario, you would perform a test migration before the final migration. To save time, you will skip the test migration in this lab. The test migration process is very similar to the final migration.

1. Return to the **Migration and modernization** overview blade. Under **Step 3: Migrate**, select **Migrate**.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' overview blade, with the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/Migration1.png "Replication summary")

2. On the **Migrate** blade, select **yes** for **Shutdown machines before migration to minimum data loss** and select the **UbuntuVM** virtual machine then select **Migrate** to start the migration process.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Migrate' blade, with 3 machines selected and the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/Migration2.png "Migrate - VM selection")

   > **Note**: You can optionally choose whether the on-premises virtual machines should be automatically shut down before migration to minimize data loss. Either setting will work for this lab.

3. The migration process will start.

   ![Screenshot showing 3 VM migration notifications.](Images/Migration3.png "Migration started notifications")

4. To monitor progress, select **Jobs** under **Manage** on the left and review the status of the three **Planned failover** jobs.

   ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with 3 in-progress 'Planned failover' jobs.](Images/Migration4.png "Migration jobs")

5. **Wait** until all three **Planned failover** jobs show a **Status** of **Successful**. You should not need to refresh your browser. This could take up to 15 minutes.

   ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with all 'Planned failover' jobs successful.](Images/Migration5.png "Migration status")

6. Navigate to the **SmartHotelRG** resource group and check that the VM, network interface, and disk resources have been created for each of the virtual machine being migrated.

   ![Screenshot showing resources created by the test failover (VMs, disks, and network interfaces).](Images/Migration6.png "Migrated resources")

#### Task summary 

In this task you used Azure Migrate to create Azure VMs using the settings you have configured, and the data replicated from the Hyper-V machines. This migrated your on-premises VMs to Azure.


### Task 6: Configure the database connection

The application tier machine **smarthotelweb2** is configured to connect to the application database running on the **smarthotelsql** machine.

On the migrated VM **smarthotelweb2**, this configuration needs to be updated to use the Azure SQL Database instead.

> **Note**: You do not need to update any configuration files on **smarthotelweb1** or the **UbuntuWAF** VMs, since the migration has preserved the private IP addresses of all virtual machines they connect with.

1. From the Azure portal menu which is present at the top left, click on **All services**. Select **compute** from the left hand menu and select **Virtual machines**.

2. Click on **smarthotelweb2** VM, from the overview blade, and select **Connect**. Select **Bastion** from the available options and click on **Use Bastion**.

   **Note:** You may have to wait a few minutes and refresh to have the option to enter the credentials. 

3. Connect to the machine with the username **Administrator** and the password <inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password"></inject>. When prompted, **Allow** clipboard access.

   ![Screenshot showing the Azure Bastion connection blade.](Images/web2-connect.png "Connect using Bastion")

4. In the **smarthotelweb2** remote desktop session, open File Explorer and navigate to the **C:\\inetpub\\SmartHotel.Registration.Wcf** folder. Double-select the **Web.config** file and open with Notepad.

5. Update the **DefaultConnection** setting to connect to your Azure SQL Database.

   You can find the connection string for the Azure SQL Database in the Azure portal. Navigate to the **SmartHotelRG** resource group, and then to the database **smarthoteldb** and  from the overview, select **Show database connection strings**.

   ![Screenshot showing the 'Show database connection strings' link for an Azure SQL Database.](Images/show-connection-strings.png "Show database connection strings")

    Copy the **ADO.NET** connection string, and paste into the web.config file on **smarthotelweb2**, replacing the existing connection string.  **Be careful not to overwrite the 'providerName' parameter which is specified after the connection string.**

    > **Note:** You may need to open the clipboard panel on the left-hand edge of the Bastion window, paste the connection string there, and then paste into the VM.

    Set the password in the connection string to **<inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password" />**.

    ![Screenshot showing the user ID and Password in the web.config database connection string.](Images/web2-connection-string.png "web.config")

6. **Save** the `web.config` file and exit your Bastion remote desktop session.

#### Task summary 

In this task, you updated the **smarthotelweb2** configuration to connect to the Azure SQL Database.

### Task 7: Configure the public IP address and test the SmartHotel application

In this task, you will associate an Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall (WAF) to replace the Ubuntu VM with the Azure managed service.

1. Navigate to the **SmartHotel-WAF** Application Gateway in the **SmartHotelRG** resource group

1. Select **Backend pools** under the Settings section, and select the **WebBackend** pool
