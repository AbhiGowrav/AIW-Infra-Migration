# Module 1: Migrating Windows & SQL Server workloads

Duration: 60 minutes

In this Module, you will use Azure Migrate: Server Assessment to assess the on-premises environment. This will include selecting Azure Migrate tools, deploying the Azure Migrate appliance into the on-premises environment, creating a migration assessment, and using the Azure Migrate dependency visualization.

### Exercise 1: Discovery, Assess, and Plan: Evaluate your current environment

In this exercise, you will deploy the Azure Migrate appliance in the on-premises Hyper-V environment. This appliance communicates with the Hyper-V server to gather configuration and performance data about your on-premises VMs, and returns that data to your Azure Migrate project.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Assess servers' page. A new server group containing servers smarthotelweb1, smarthotelweb2, and UbuntuWAF.](Images/create%20assessment.png "Assessment VM group")

    **Note:** There is no need to include the **smarthotelSQL1** or **AzureMigrateAppliance** VMs in the assessment, since they will not be migrated to Azure. (The SQL Server will be migrated to the SQL Database service and the Azure Migrate Appliance is only used for migration assessment.)

5. Click on **Create assessment** to create the assessment. 

   ![](Images/create%20assessment1.png)

6. On the **Servers, databases and web apps** blade, select **Refresh** periodically until the number of assessments shown is **1** (This may take few minutes). Once the assessments count is updated, click on **1** that is next to **Total** under **Assessments**.  

    ![Screenshot from Azure Migrate showing the number of assessments as '1'.](Images/E1T4S6.png "Azure Migrate - Assessments (count)")
    
7. Select **Assessments** under **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment** to see a list of assessments. Then select the actual assessment.

   ![Screenshot showing a list of Azure Migrate assessments. There is only one assessment in the list. It has been highlighted.](Images/assessment-list-v2.png "Azure Migrate - Assessments (list)")

8. Take a moment to study the assessment overview and select **Settings**..

   ![Screenshot showing an Azure Migrate assessment overview for the SmartHotel application.](Images/E1T4S8.png "Assessment - Overview")

9. Note how you can now modify the assessment properties you choose earlier. Change a selection of settings, and **Save** your changes. After a few moments, the assessment report will update to reflect your changes.

10. Select **Azure readiness** (either the chart or on the left navigation). Note that for the **UbuntuWAF** VM, a specific concern is listed regarding the readiness of the VM for migration.

    ![Screenshot showing the Azure Migrate assessment report on the VM readiness page, with the VM readiness for each VM highlighted.](Images/E1T4S10.png "Assessment - VM readiness for Azure")

11. Select **Unknown OS** for **UbuntuWAF**. A new browser tab opens showing Azure Migrate documentation. Note on the page that the issue relates the OS not being specified in the host hypervisor, so you must confirm the OS type and version is supported.

12. Return to the portal browser tab and select **UbuntuWAF** VM to view details of the issue. Note the recommendation to migrate the VM using **Azure Migrate: Server Migration**.

13. Take a few minutes to explore other aspects of the migration assessment.

>**Note**: The process of gathering information of operating system environments (OSE) and migrating data of VMs between environments takes some time due to the nature of transferring data.  However, there are a few steps that can be done to speed up and view how the system works.  These are a few options:
>
> Common steps to refresh data: (also see [Troubleshoot Discovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/troubleshoot-discovery#common-software-inventory-errors))
> 
> -	[Server data not updating in portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/troubleshoot-discovery#server-data-not-updating-in-portal) – if the servers’ data is not refreshing, this is a method to accelerate it.
> 
> -	[Do not see software inventory details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/troubleshoot-discovery#do-not-see-software-inventory-details-even-after-updating-guest-credentials) – by default the software inventory is only refreshed once every 24 hours. This forces a refresh.
> 
> -	[Software inventory errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/troubleshoot-discovery#common-software-inventory-errors) – during inventory there are sometimes error codes returned. This lists all the error codes and meanings.
>
>_Refresh Data_
> 
> Many issues in the Migrate can be related to the appliance not refreshing the data due to regular schedules or data not being transferred.  Forcing the data and information to be updated can be achieved with the following steps:
> 1.	In Servers, databases and web apps > Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment, select Overview.
> 2.	Under Manage, select Appliances.
> 3.	Select Refresh services.
> 4.	Wait for the refresh operation to complete. You should now see up-to-date information.

#### Task summary 

In this task you created and configured an Azure Migrate migration assessment.

### Task 3: Configure dependency visualization

When migrating a workload to Azure, it is important to understand all workload dependencies. A broken dependency could mean that the application doesn't run properly in Azure, perhaps in hard-to-detect ways. Some dependencies, such as those between application tiers, are obvious. Other dependencies, such as DNS lookups, Kerberos ticket validation or certificate revocation checks, are not.

In this task, you will configure the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature. This requires you to first create a Log Analytics workspace, and then to deploy agents on the to-be-migrated VMs.

1. Return to the **Azure Migrate** blade in the Azure Portal, select **Servers, databases and web apps (1)**. Under **Discovery and assessment** select **Groups (2)**,

    ![](Images/E1T5S1.png)   

2. Select the **SmartHotel VMs** group to see the group details. 

   ![](Images/select-group.png)   

3. Note that each VM has their **Dependencies** status as **Requires agent installation**. Select **Requires agent installation** for the **smarthotelweb1** VM.

   ![Screenshot showing the SmartHotel VMs group. Each VM has dependency status 'Requires agent installation'.](Images/requires-agent-installation-v2.png "SmartHotel VMs server group")

4. On the **Dependencies** blade, select **Configure Log Analytics workspace**.

    ![Screenshot for installing Dependency Agent.](Images/dependencyagent2.png "Dependency Agent installation") 
 

   > **Note:** You do not need to configure the workspace ID and key when installing the Dependency Agent, since it uses the same settings as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, which must be installed beforehand.

23. Return to the Azure Portal and refresh the Azure Migrate **SmartHotel VMs** VM group blade. The 3 VMs on which the dependency agent was installed should now show their status as **Installed**. (If not, refresh the page **using the browser refresh button**, not the refresh button in the blade.  It may take up to **5 minutes** after installation for the status to be updated.)

   ![Screenshot showing the dependency agent installed on each VM in the Azure Migrate VM group.](Images/dependency-viz-installed.png "Dependency agent installed")
   
   >**Note**: If you notice that the dependency agent status is showing as **Requires Agent Installation** instead of Installed even after installing dependency agents in all the three VMs, please follow the steps from [here](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Know-Before-You-Go/blob/main/AIW-KBYG/AIW-Infrastructure-Migration.md#4-exercise1---task6---step1) to confirm dependency agent installation in VMs using Log Analytics workspace.
 
24. Select **View dependencies**.

   ![Screenshot showing the view dependencies button in the Azure Migrate VM group blade.](Images/view-dependencies.png "View dependencies")
   
25. Take a few minutes to explore the dependencies view. Expand each server to show the processes running on that server. Select a process to see process information. See which connections each server makes.
