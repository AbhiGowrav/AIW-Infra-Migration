# Module 1: Migrating Windows & SQL Server workloads

Duration: 60 minutes

In this Module, you will use Azure Migrate: Server Assessment to assess the on-premises environment. This will include selecting Azure Migrate tools, deploying the Azure Migrate appliance into the on-premises environment, creating a migration assessment, and using the Azure Migrate dependency visualization.

### Exercise 1: Discovery, Assess, and Plan: Evaluate your current environment

In this exercise, you will deploy the Azure Migrate appliance in the on-premises Hyper-V environment. This appliance communicates with the Hyper-V server to gather configuration and performance data about your on-premises VMs, and returns that data to your Azure Migrate project.

1. If you are not logged in already, click on Azure portal shortcut that is available on the desktop and log in with below Azure credentials.
    * Azure Username/Email: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> 
    * Azure Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

2. Click on **Show Portal Menu (1)** bar and select **All services (2)** in the portal's left navigation.

### Exercise 2: Set up your environment on Azure to migrate servers 

#### Task 1: Add assessment and migration tools to Azure migrate project 


### Task 2: Create a migration assessment

In this task, you will use Azure Migrate to create a migration assessment for the SmartHotel application, using the data gathered during the discovery phase.

1. Select **Assess** under **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment** and click on **Azure VM** to start a new migration assessment.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate portal blade, with the '+Assess' button highlighted.](Images/start-assess-v2.png "Start assessment")

2. On the Assess servers blade, ensure the Assessment type to be **Azure VM** and Discovery Source to be **Servers discovered from Migrate Appliance**. Under **Assessment settings**, select **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Assess servers' blade, showing the assessment name.](Images/assessment1.png "Assess servers - assessment name")

3. The **Assessment settings** blade allows you to tailor many of the settings used when making a migration assessment report. Take a few moments to explore the wide range of assessment properties. Hover over the information icons to see more details on each setting. Choose any settings you like, then select **Save**. (You have to make a change for the Save button to be enabled; if you don't want to make any changes, just close the blade.)

   ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Assessment properties' blade, showing a wide range of migration assessment settings.](Images/assessment2.png "Assessment properties")

4. Select **Next** to move to the **Select servers to assess** tab and enter the following information:
     
     1. Assessment name: Enter **SmartHotelAssessment** 
     1. Select or create a group: Choose **Create New** and enter the 
     1. Group name: Enter **SmartHotel VMs**.
     1. Add machines to the Group:  Select **SmarthotelAppl** from dropdown.
     1. Select the **smarthotelweb1**, **smarthotelweb2** and **UbuntuWAF** VMs and
     1.  Click on **Next**.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Assess servers' page. A new server group containing servers smarthotelweb1, smarthotelweb2, and UbuntuWAF.](Images/create%20assessment.png "Assessment VM group")

    **Note:** There is no need to include the **smarthotelSQL1** or **AzureMigrateAppliance** VMs in the assessment, since they will not be migrated to Azure. (The SQL Server will be migrated to the SQL Database service and the Azure Migrate Appliance is only used for migration assessment.)

5. Click on **Create assessment** to create the assessment. 

   ![](Images/create%20assessment1.png)

6. On the **Servers, databases and web apps** blade, select **Refresh** periodically until the number of assessments shown is **1** (This may take few minutes). Once the assessments count is updated, click on **1** that is next to **Total** under **Assessments**.  

    ![Screenshot from Azure Migrate showing the number of assessments as '1'.](Images/E1T4S6.png "Azure Migrate - Assessments (count)")
    
7. Select **Assessments** under **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment** to see a list of assessments. Then select the actual assessment.

### Task 3: Configure dependency visualization

When migrating a workload to Azure, it is important to understand all workload dependencies. A broken dependency could mean that the application doesn't run properly in Azure, perhaps in hard-to-detect ways. Some dependencies, such as those between application tiers, are obvious. Other dependencies, such as DNS lookups, Kerberos ticket validation or certificate revocation checks, are not.

In this task, you will configure the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature. This requires you to first create a Log Analytics workspace, and then to deploy agents on the to-be-migrated VMs.

1. Return to the **Azure Migrate** blade in the Azure Portal, select **Servers, databases and web apps (1)**. Under **Discovery and assessment** select **Groups (2)**,

    ![](Images/E1T5S1.png)   

2. Select the **SmartHotel VMs** group to see the group details. 

   ![](Images/select-group.png)   

3. Note that each VM has their **Dependencies** status as **Requires agent installation**. Select **Requires agent installation** for the **smarthotelweb1** VM.

   ![Screenshot showing the SmartHotel VMs group. Each VM has dependency status 'Requires agent installation'.](Images/requires-agent-installation-v2.png "SmartHotel VMs server group")

4. On the **Dependencies** blade, select **Configure Log Analytics workspace**.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Dependencies' blade, with the 'Configure OMS Workspace' button highlighted.](Images/configureLAW.png "Configure OMS Workspace link")

   > **Note:** You do not need to configure the workspace ID and key when installing the Dependency Agent, since it uses the same settings as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, which must be installed beforehand.

23. Return to the Azure Portal and refresh the Azure Migrate **SmartHotel VMs** VM group blade. The 3 VMs on which the dependency agent was installed should now show their status as **Installed**. (If not, refresh the page **using the browser refresh button**, not the refresh button in the blade.  It may take up to **5 minutes** after installation for the status to be updated.)

   ![Screenshot showing the dependency agent installed on each VM in the Azure Migrate VM group.](Images/dependency-viz-installed.png "Dependency agent installed")
   
   >**Note**: If you notice that the dependency agent status is showing as **Requires Agent Installation** instead of Installed even after installing dependency agents in all the three VMs, please follow the steps from [here](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Know-Before-You-Go/blob/main/AIW-KBYG/AIW-Infrastructure-Migration.md#4-exercise1---task6---step1) to confirm dependency agent installation in VMs using Log Analytics workspace.
 
24. Select **View dependencies**.

   ![Screenshot showing the view dependencies button in the Azure Migrate VM group blade.](Images/view-dependencies.png "View dependencies")
   
25. Take a few minutes to explore the dependencies view. Expand each server to show the processes running on that server. Select a process to see process information. See which connections each server makes.
